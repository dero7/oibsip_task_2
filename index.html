            <p class="font">
                Mahatma Gandhi was an Indian independence activist who led the nonviolent civil disobedience movement against British colonial rule in India. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and civil disobedience, which he called Satyagraha, became the cornerstone of his political activism. He fought for the rights of India's untouchable caste, or Dalits, and worked to improve the status of women in Indian society. Gandhi led a number of successful campaigns against the British, including the Salt March in 1930. In 1947, India achieved independence from British rule, but was partitioned into India and Pakistan. Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist in January 1948. He is widely revered in India and around the world as a spiritual and political leader who championed the principles of nonviolence, social justice, and human rights.

                Mahatma Gandhi led numerous campaigns and movements throughout his life, all with the aim of achieving India's independence from British colonial rule. Some of the major events and movements fought by Gandhi include:
                <ol type="number" class="font">
                    <li>Non-cooperation Movement: In 1920, Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, which called on Indians to boycott British goods and institutions. The movement quickly gained momentum, and within months, millions of Indians had joined the movement.</li>
                    <li>
                    Salt Satyagraha: In 1930, Gandhi led the Salt Satyagraha, a campaign against the British salt tax. As a symbol of defiance, Gandhi and thousands of followers marched to the sea to make salt, which was illegal under British law. The Salt Satyagraha attracted widespread international attention and put pressure on the British government to negotiate with Indian leaders.

                    Quit India Movement: In 1942, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, which called on the British to leave India immediately. The movement was met with harsh repression by the British authorities, but it galvanized the Indian people and helped to hasten India's independence.

                    Harijan Movement: Gandhi was a vocal advocate for the rights of India's untouchable caste, or Dalits, and launched the Harijan Movement in 1932 to improve their social status and end discrimination against them. Gandhi referred to the Dalits as Harijans, which means "children of God."

                    Women's Rights: Gandhi was also a strong advocate for women's rights and worked to improve their status in Indian society. He supported women's education and economic empowerment, and encouraged women to participate in political and social movements.
